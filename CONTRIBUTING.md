# How to contribute

Since this is an old project, I would be pleased if it could just be "rebooted".

That means that I am open to suggestions and new ideas.

Documentantion about installing it, using it etc is also very welcome may it be in the form of code comments or another .md file.

Just make it plain and simple.
