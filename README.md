# rigrep

## How to use

After you clone this repo, you should get yourself a Linux terminal. Kidding.

You should run rigrepdb.py first with the first argument being the folder/directory you want it to index/"crawl".
This will create the necessary .index file which will be used by rigrep.py afterwards.

Run rigrep.py with the word you are looking for as the first argument.
